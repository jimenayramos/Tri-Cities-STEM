## Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of socio-economic factors, K-12 education performance metrics, and local labor market trends relevant to the Kiona-Benton City School District. The goal is to inform community stakeholders, educators, and policymakers about current challenges, opportunities, and the future demand for occupations in the Tri-Cities metropolitan area.

The analysis was presented at the Tri-Cities STEM Career Connect Southeast on June 18, 2025.

## Objectives
- Compare socio-economic indicators between Benton City and the broader Tri-Cities metro area.
- Examine K-12 student performance trends over the past decade.
- Assess future occupational demand requiring post-secondary education.
- Identify challenges and opportunities for improving educational and workforce outcomes.

## Data Sources
- U.S. Census Bureau – American Community Survey (5-year estimates)
- Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) – Education metrics
- WA Employment Security Department – Labor Market Information

## Methodology
1. Data Collection – Gathered socio-economic, education, and labor market datasets from trusted public sources.
2. Data Cleaning & Processing – Adjusted for small sample sizes using non-overlapping 5-year averages.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Used statistical comparisons and visualizations to identify trends.
4. Visualization – Created clear, accessible charts for stakeholder presentation.

## Tools & Technologies
- Languages: R, excel
- Libraries: ggplot, dplyr(R)
- Presentation: Microsoft PowerPoint

## Key Insights
- Median Age: Benton City is ~7 years younger than the Tri-Cities average.
- Income & Wages: Median household income similar to the metro average, but median earnings are lower.
- Poverty: Slightly higher rates in Benton City (~1 in 7 residents).
- K-12 Performance: WaKIDS readiness doubled over the decade.
  - High school ELA and math scores have declined post-pandemic.
  - Graduation rates stable, but post-secondary enrollment remains lower.
- Labor Market Outlook: Strong demand forecast for healthcare, STEM, and business occupations, with much of the talent likely needing to be “imported” without increased local enrollment in higher education.
